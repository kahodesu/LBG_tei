LBG_main
========

This is for a 2 person game I am working on. 
It goes with LBG_phone1 and LBG_phone2. 
You need all 3 code to run it. 
I am using Processing for all 3 codes. 

Android Phones: 
================
I am using 2 Android phones -- Nexus ones. 
I am using OSC to communicate with both, largely based on a tutorial that can be found here: 
http://takepepe.com/processing-x-android-001/
I am using the Ketai library. 
The Accelerometer code is based on the Ketai library example. 

IOIO Boards:
==============
I am using Pioio library to use the IOIO board. 
Each phone has a IOIO board attached to it. 
I am using the IOIO boards from Adafruit because they have power and a case.
